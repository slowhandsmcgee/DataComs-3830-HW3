I used 3 classes to calculate the shortest path from a source node to the destination node using Dijkstra's algothrithm. The main LinkState class contains the Node class, which holds information that's needed for the node, such as id, possible destinations (using a Map), and a list of shortest paths to other nodes. The LinkState class also contains a Graph class, which handles connections between nodes, and calculating the shortest path between those nodes.
